            <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
            <p>
                The easybill Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring
                assignment</em>. These rings use the following semantics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in
                    large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our easybill production environment, low risk and
                    recommended to be widely used.
                </li>
                <li><strong>WORKS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to
                    solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover
                    limitations. WORKS technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked
                    this path and will share knowledge and experiences.
                </li>
                <li><strong>INTERESTING</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential
                    value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it
                    has impact. INTERESTING technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven
                    in our organisation. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote
                    it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.
                </li>
                <li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies
                    that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for
                    new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.
                </li>
                <li><strong>ADOPTED BUT BAD</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we currently use in our productive
                    environment
                    and are deeply rooted there, but which are problematic or outdated. These technologies are to be
                    gradually replaced and should no longer be used in new projects.
                </li>
                <li><strong>BAD</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have used in the past but which have since been
                    classified as unsuitable, inefficient or obsolete. Under no circumstances should these technologies
                    be used in new projects or for new features in current projects. We no longer support their use in
                    our productive environment.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>
            <p>
                The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at easybill to pick the best
                technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies,
                to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the <a
                    href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets
                out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we
                think our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects.
            </p>

            <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>
            <p>
                The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Software Engineers</em>. Assignment of technologies to rings is
                the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Tech Radar is open for
                contribution for all Engineering teams at easybill and depends on their active participation to share
                lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.
            </p>
